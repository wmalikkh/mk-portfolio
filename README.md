A high-performance personal portfolio engineered to simulate a secure system interface. It bridges the gap between low-level hardware design and modern web architecture.

## ⚡ Core Features

* **Biometric Login Simulation:** A custom CSS animation sequence simulating a secure identity verification handshake.
* **3D Holographic Tilt:** Interactive UI cards that respond to mouse coordinates using 3D perspective physics (no external libraries).
* **Reactive "Violet" Theme:** A unified design language featuring neon violet accents, dynamic glows, and glassmorphism.
* **Responsive Grid Architecture:** Fully adaptive layout that scales from 4K desktop monitors down to mobile viewports.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Animations, Flexbox/Grid, 3D Transforms).
* **Scripting:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for DOM manipulation and logic.
* **Performance:** Zero dependencies, lightweight assets, sub-second load times.
